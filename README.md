Python
======

A repository for all of my "mini" scripts that I write in python.
A mini script in this case is just a simple program that does something well... simple.  Like a calculator.


All of the files in this repository can be used and adapted in anyway you want, but you must keep the thing that runs at the beginning of
every script that says "This script by Jesse Wallace(upd8er) jessewallaceblog.wordpress.com"
